     * PATCH /jobs/{job_id} : Modify a batch job
     * Modifies an existing job at the back-end but maintains the identifier. Changes can be grouped in a single request.  Jobs can only be modified when the job is not queued or running. Otherwise requests to this endpoint MUST be rejected with openEO error &#x60;JobLocked&#x60;.
     *
     * @param jobId Unique job identifier. (required)
     * @param updateBatchJobRequest  (required)
     * @return Changes to the job applied successfully. (status code 204)
     *         or The request can&#39;t be fulfilled due to an error on client-side, i.e. the request is invalid. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.  The response body SHOULD contain a JSON error object. MUST be any HTTP status code specified in [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6). This request MUST respond with HTTP status codes 401 if authorization is required or 403 if the authorization failed or access is forbidden in general to the authenticated user. HTTP status code 404 should be used if the value of a path parameter is invalid.  See also: * [Error Handling](#section/API-Principles/Error-Handling) in the API in general. * [Common Error Codes](errors.json) (status code 400)
     *         or The request can&#39;t be fulfilled due to an error at the back-end. The error is never the client’s fault and therefore it is reasonable for the client to retry the exact same request that triggered this response.  The response body SHOULD contain a JSON error object. MUST be any HTTP status code specified in [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6).
